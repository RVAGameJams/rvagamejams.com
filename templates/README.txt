IMPORTANT!!!	When creating any .txt file:

-	Text files contain items and descriptions.
-	The shortcut for the file is the name of the .txt
	file. Use snake_case, not camelCase!
-	Items are separated by three dashes ("---"), so
	don't use three dashes in your item descriptions!
-	Item descriptions are separated from their titles
	with two colons ("::"), so don't use those either!
-	If there is no info for a particular item, 
	remove the line from the document!
		ex: If your game has no playlink, just
		delete the line with "playlink::" - you
		can delete the separator as well ("---")

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating a game:

-	Use the event's shortcut for "event"
		ex: CORRECT usage:	"event::ld27"
		INCORRECT usage:	"event::Ludum Dare 27"
-	Make sure to upload an image to /games/images/
	with the SAME shortcut name as the game!
-	Also make sure that image is a PNG or a GIF!
	(Animated game images are awesome!)
	Make sure the size is bigger than 200x200px
	
-	Key:
	title:		The title/name of the game
	author:		The developer(s) of the game
	event:		What event at which the game was made
	playlink:	A link to a web-version of the game
	jamlink:	A link to the game's submission page
	description:	A description of the game

When creating an event:

-	Date format: YYYY-MM-DD
	ex: 2017-12-25 (it's christmas!)
-	Yeah I know that date format is weird, but it
	makes the most sense when sorting! Trust me!
-	If you are creating an event that has already
	taken place, you can ignore these items:
		-	directions		-	infolink
		-	rsvplink		-	opentime
		-	dateend			-	description
	But make sure to include these!
		-	event			-	venue
		-	vlink			-	datestart
-	Make sure to upload an image to /events/images/
	with the SAME shortcut name as the event!
-	Also make sure that image is a PNG with these
	EXACT dimensions: 970x360px

-	Key:
	event:		The title/name of the event
	venue:		The venue of the event
	vlink:		A link to the venue's website
	directions:	A link to the venue on google maps
	infolink:	A link to more info (ex:ldjam.com)
	rsvplink:	A link to the facebook event page
	opentime:	Time when venue doors are open to event
	datestart:	The starting date of the event
	dateend:	The ending date of the event
	description:	A description of the event
