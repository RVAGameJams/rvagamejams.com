The Golden Delights and Infinite Perils of Planet Monster is a Tower Defense game where you make lots of money for some space corporation by harvesting gold from PLANET MONSTER! 

Start a game by clicking with the mouse, you can switch between Walls, Turrets, Upgrading, and Selling with the numbers 1-4 on your keyboard, or by clicking them at the bottom of the screen. 

Made with: 
FlashDevelop 
Flixel 
Photoshop 
MilkyTracker 

YEAH! ENJOY! 

*UPDATE* I fixed a bug that would give a Game Over after one hit, also made that Cash indicator faster :D 

*UPDATE* Whoops - I never tested it in Firefox, should be working now :) Thanks GFM and Antonijn for bringing it to my attention!
