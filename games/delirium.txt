/////////// 

A click-and-pick adventure game drawn, programmed, and animated entirely in Flash. 

CONTROLS: Mouse only. Move left/right, click to jump, and click on objects. 
HINT: Click the bed to travel between worlds. 

DISCLAIMER: Sorry the collision detection is garbage-- I'm learning! Also, sometimes objects are hard to click because they are behind the player. Try moving the player out of the way.
