description::Your goal: Create the MOST POPULAR vampire-owned garden ever! 

Click to plant! ($1) 
Hire vampires for your garden! ($10/day, +1 fear) 
Avoid a reputation for being a place of murder! (Priceless) 

Visitors pay $5 per plant viewed. MORE will visit the more popular your garden is. 

Popularity is based on a COMPLEX FORMULA based on number of healthy plants and amount of fear surrounding your garden. 

Fear is increased by recruiting a vampire gardener. Since in this case "recruiting" means biting and murdering someone and condemning them to an eternity as a low-paid vegetarian vampire gardener. Rumors will spread. 


Notes: 
- bugfix update that keeps the plants from always dying, despite the best efforts of the gard'ners.
