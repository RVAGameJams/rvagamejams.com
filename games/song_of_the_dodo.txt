description::The year is 1507 on the small island of Mauritius. 

You play a flock of docile dodo birds as they go about their business as they've done for millennia. 

But Portuguese sailors have recently arrived on the island, and have brought strange new animals with them. How long can you survive their onslaught? 

W,A,S,D to control, with Space for jump.
