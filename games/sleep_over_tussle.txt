description::Instructions: 

Move with WASD 
Aim with Mouse 
Left Click to Melee Attack 
Right Click to use Secondary Ability (which you pick up) 

The more you kill the higher your score. 

Pick up the diamonds to gain a secondary ability. 
Red - gives you arrows 
Green - lets you dash through enemies to harm them (while taking reduced damage) 
Orange - stuns all enemies near you 


Description: 

You are having an ultimate battle royal sleep over with all of your best buds! That means there will be a lot of tussling. Fight all your friends as long as you can! 

(note friends, sleep over, and fighting should be left up to your imagination because I can't actually draw any of that)
