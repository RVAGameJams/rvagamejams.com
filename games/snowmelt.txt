description::You play as a snowman, beset on all sides by vicious, destructive kids! Your only weapon - snowballs. But be careful - the more snowballs you make, the faster you melt! Luckily for you, someone's sliding blocks of ice through the streets; hopefully those can re-freeze you! 

Left Click - throw snowball 
Right Click - make snowball 
Pause / Space - pause 

The game ends if the bar at right hits the bottom 
Keep those destructive kids from smashing you to bits! 
Pelt ice blocks with snowballs to re-freeze yourself
