description::
Take an generic, bad, old-school RPG, and strip out everything but the bones. That elusive thing called 'fun'? Make sure you grab that too. And make sure to accentuate the grind. 

Awful game? Social commentary? Sure, why not! 

-ADDED BONUS: It's short. 



CONTROLS: Arrow keys to navigate, [Z] to select.
