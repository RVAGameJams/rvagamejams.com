It is HIGHLY recommended that you use a 360 controller to play, but for scrubs with no gamepad use secret code X+C to play, mouse for minigames, and ESC to exit on Windows :) 

the water pressure in Benten is wack! help mungo fix everybody's pipes! 

Thanks @rezoner for the awesome splash screen :D 

(back button on XBOX360 controller quits on Windows)
