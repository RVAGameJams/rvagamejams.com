description::You are a bomb. A minimalist bomb. Avoid obstacles by squeezing between them, but don't squeeze too hard: you need to skim the walls to increase your time. Hit something or run out of time, and it's game over. 

It's Super Hexagon meets an endless runner!

If anyone is interested. I have put up an HTML5 version on itch.io. It's buggy, so I don't want to use it for the compo, but if you want more, you can play Timebomb on the go (with Chrome). http://elanti.itch.io/timebomb
