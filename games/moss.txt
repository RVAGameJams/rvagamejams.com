Spacebar to jump. If you feel like you're getting stuck holding spacebar should get you out of most situations. 

There's no 'end-state' or way to exit so you'll have to alt+tab and kill the program etc. 

If it's running slow for you, go ahead and try turning down the graphics and resolution a lot; doesn't seem to make the game look all that different and you'll get higher frames per second! 

Moss is a game where you play as Moss! Grow over rocks! I was sort of tangentially related to the theme, but I couldn't get some of the animations to work, so now its just a more relaxing moss game that has nothing to do with weapons!
