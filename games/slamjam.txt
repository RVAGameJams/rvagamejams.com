description::This is another version of "Breakout", except the paddle can now hit the ball by swinging it like a tennis racket, which can cause the ball to move fast. The faster the ball, the more powerful it gets. 

Note: The game has a bug where the ball vanishes, so I programmed it so when the ball vanishes, another ball spans with no effect on lives.
