description::A game about finding a way 

Heed my warning: to anyone who gets motion-sickness from games or who has other visual sensitivity, I STRONGLY discourage you from playing! The game is intentionally visually disorienting! 

The Non-Smearing build is advised as an alternative if you have any problems with the buffer non-clearing effect. 

MAC-OS and LINUX UPDATE: ugh, when running under opengl in certain configurations, the background flickers wildly. This appears to be caused by double-buffering settings that unity has left out of my control. I am very sorry. 

// Known Issues 
-strobing on some opengl-dependent builds 
-mouse-relative movement hits edge of screen on mac-osx
