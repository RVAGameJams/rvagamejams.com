description::This game was created from scratch over the past 24 hours (late start!) so I apologize for the short length of the game. 

On the theme of evolution, I obviously wanted to create a game based off of some game that I've never played before that I understand to be chock-full of evolving creatures. I chose the title Negemon because Negentropicmon wouldn't as a logo. 

I hope you enjoy it! 

I neglected to mention the frameworks and tools I used! 

Frameworks: Flixel, Flixel Power Tools, and Greensock TweenLite. (all of these are required to build source) 

Tools: FlashDevelop, Photoshop, MilkyTracker, FLStudio, Magical 8bit Plugin, and Bfxr.
