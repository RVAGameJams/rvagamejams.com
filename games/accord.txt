A musical platformer. 

- Stay off the ground while the song is playing 
- A/D or arrow keys to move left/right. 
- Press and *hold* 'Space' to jump and double jump 
- Don't forget to double jump 
- Try to finesse the jump keypresses (timing and longevity) 

I only had enough time to make 2 short levels for this game, so I took a shortcut and made 'hard' versions of each to represent levels 3 and 4. 

Thanks for playing!
