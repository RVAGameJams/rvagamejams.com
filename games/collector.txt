description::Use the monster to destroy the invading tower. 

Move with the arrow keys. Pick up items with Z, and put them back down with X. Figure out what everything does. 

It's basically a tech demo. 

Edit: Updated binaries w/ minor bug fixes. Linux is tested and should work. Mac and Windows testing would be appreciated.
