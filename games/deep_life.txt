WARNING! This game looks like a shmup, but it is in fact VERY narrative driven and dialog heavy. Sorry! 

Controls: 
SPACEBAR - Navigate menu, Skip Dialog, Aim Laser 
ARROW KEYS - Movement 

I would have liked for there to be more action, but this theme really threw me for a loop. Anyway, hope you enjoy!
