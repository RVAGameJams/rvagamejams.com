RVA Game Jams is a community project created in 2012 to get video game developers and enthusiasts from the Richmond area together to participate in game jams, learn more about developing games, network with each other, host speakers, events and more. We are interested in exploring games as a form of art, communication and entertainment.

RVA Game Jams aims to support and develop the creative, tech-savvy game development community in the Richmond area and beyond!
